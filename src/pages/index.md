  title: Changing the narrative of the American military veteran
  description: >-
    The primary under-represented groups that MVA serves are: veterans of color,
    womxn, LGBTQ, and religious and non-religious minorities. We believe that in
    bringing these four minority groups together we can build a community that
    encompasses veterans from a wide range of diverse backgrounds and
    experiences.

  Founded in November 2017, the Minority Veterans of America (MVA) is a 501(c)3
  non-profit organization that was designed to change the narrative of the
  American military veteran. The team of MVA works to build community around the
  unique identities that veterans hold, outside of their identity as a military
  servicemember.  The primary underrepresented groups that MVA serves are:
  veterans of color, womxn, LGBTQ, and religious and non-religious minorities.
  We believe that through bringing these four minority groups together, we can
  build a veteran community that encompasses veterans from a wide range of
  diverse backgrounds and experiences.  MVA was founded by two University of
  Washington Husky veterans, Lindsay Church and Katherine Pratt. Church and
  Pratt first began their work in 2014 through the Husky United Military
  Veterans where they built a Diversity Committee that celebrated the
  underrepresented groups within the student veteran community at the University
  of Washington.  Since 2014, Church and Pratt have collaborated to lead the
  student veteran population at the UW, Church through her role in the Student
  Veteran Life office, and Pratt as the President of the student veteran
  organization, Husky Veterans. Today, they partner to build and grow MVA in
  order to celebrate the identities that they both feel that they hold that make
  them underrepresented in the veteran community.
