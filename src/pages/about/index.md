## Mission
The mission of Minority Veterans of America (MVA) is to create belonging and advance equity for underrepresented veterans.

## Vision
The objective of MVA is to succeed in the following four areas:

- To change and shape the narrative and public image of the U.S. veteran to reflect the diverse backgrounds of our current and past service members. Through storytelling campaigns we will capture the perspectives of the underrepresented veteran to ensure that their stories are added to the tapestry of the American veteran.
- To build a community of minority veterans that becomes large enough and loud enough to create a new type of majority in the veteran population. We will do this through grassroots organizing, canvassing, collaborating with existing veteran and community organizations, and networking.
- To earn a seat at the highest tables of veteran leadership in the country in order to advocate for the unique needs of U.S. underrepresented veterans. As a non-partisan organization, we will work with current leadership and lawmakers to shape policy that impacts the individuals that we serve.
- To grow and mentor new leaders who will go out into the world and change the public’s idea of what a veteran is, what we look like, and what we represent. Through developing peer-to-peer mentorship and leadership programs, we will empower our members and ensure that they have the tools that they need to succeed.

## Values
MVA is built on the following fundamental values that we use as our guiding principles for our organization: 

+ Inclusivity – We are inclusive of veterans of all walks of life. No matter what identities veterans or civilians hold, there is a place in the MVA for everyone.
+ Advocacy – By bringing together communities of underrepresented veterans, we are able to hear the voices and stories and better understand the needs of those that we wish to serve. In properly advocating for the needs of our constituents, we have the opportunity to change the landscape of services for those who feel as though they have been forgotten in the veteran community.
+ Allyship - History has shown us that if we do not find a way to work together, we will lose our seat at the table and our communities will suffer for it.  Through building a united community around all identities, we are bigger, stronger, and more capable of fighting for change together and winning.
+ Education – Education is the primary means for impacting lasting change. Through educational programs, we will offer trainings about the needs of underrepresented groups in the veteran community. We also work within the communities by offering mentorship programs for both recently separated service members and others looking to improve through personal and professional development.
